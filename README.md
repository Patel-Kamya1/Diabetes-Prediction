# Diabetes Prediction System

This is a machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of diabetes using a Random Forest model. It takes various health parameters as input and gives a prediction through a simple Streamlit interface.

## Features

- Predicts diabetes based on user input  
- Random Forest classifier used for training  
- Streamlit-based web interface  
- Easy-to-use form for entering health details

## Files

- `app.py` → Streamlit app code for prediction  
- `Diabetes.ipynb` → Notebook with model training and evaluation  
- `diabetes.csv` → Dataset used for training  
- `img.jpeg` → Image used in the Streamlit UI  

## How It Works

1. User enters personal health data like glucose level, BMI, age, etc.  
2. Data is processed and passed to the trained model  
3. Model predicts whether the person is likely to have diabetes  
4. Result is displayed on the web app
